# Phone-Email-Scraper-using-Python
A very small python program for scrapping out phone numbers and emails from a big chunk of strings. I kept this program as simple as possible.
I took 222-555-1546 this kind of phone number as a standard while making this project. Anyone can change the pattern.

I make this project using two package modules. 
1. Regular Expression (import re)
2. PyperClip  (import pyperclip)

To use these packages you have to have 'pip' install. Uisng pip you can install the 'pyperclip' module too.
